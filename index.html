<h2>Look back and reflect</h2>
<body>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Looking back over the first portion of your journey reflect on what you have learned and experienced so far. Each of Reflection will build on the last. They are meant to stimulate thought and contemplation to help guide your journey.  </p>

<p>Being able to review progress from an objective stand point is an important skill to have in one's toolbox. Progress can be made in countless ways, however, the perceived amount made is defined by the metrics used to measure it. Try not to limit the amount of progress made by limiting the scope of how you measure your progress.</p>
